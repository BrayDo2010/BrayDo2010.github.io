									<h3>Plants Vs. Zombies</h3>
									<p> What do you do when there’s a zombie on your lawn? If you answered "start planting flowers to defeat it," then you’ve likely heard of Plants vs. Zombies. Armed with dozens of zombie-zapping plants, from the classic peashooter to the devious cherry bomb, you’ll need to think fast and plant faster to stop all types of zombies dead in their tracks. And just when you think you’ve got a handle on things, obstacles like a setting sun, creeping fog, and a swimming pool add to the challenge. With 5 game modes to dig into, the fun never dies!</p>

									<h3>SuperHot</h3>
									<p>Superhot is an independent first-person shooter video game developed and published by Superhot Team. Though the game follows traditional first-person shooter gameplay mechanics, with the player attempting to take out enemy targets using guns and other weapons, time within the game progresses at normal speed only when the player moves; this creates the opportunity for the player to assess their situation in slow motion and respond appropriately, making the gameplay similar to strategy video games. The game is presented in a minimalist art style, with enemies in red and weapons in black, in contrast to the otherwise white and grey environment.</p>

									<h3>Five Nights At Freddys</h3>
									<p>Welcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman. From your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!</p>

									<h3>Five Nights At Freddys 4</h3>
									<p>In this last chapter of the Five Nights at Freddy's original story, you must once again defend yourself against Freddy Fazbear, Chica, Bonnie, Foxy, and even worse things that lurk in the shadows. Playing as a child whose role is yet unknown, you must safeguard yourself until 6am by watching the doors, as well as warding off unwanted creatures that may venture into your closet or onto the bed behind you. You have only a flashlight to protect yourself. It will scare away things that may be creeping at the far end of the hallways, but be careful, and listen. If something has crept too close, then shining lights in its eyes will be your end.</p>
